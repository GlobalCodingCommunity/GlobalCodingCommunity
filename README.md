🚀 Global Coding Community (GCC) 🚀
Welcome to the Global Coding Community (GCC)! We’re a passionate group of individuals from around the world, helping each other prepare for technical interviews and careers in global tech companies. 🌍 Our focus spans coding, technical skills, and behavioral interview prep, fostering a space where driven professionals and aspiring developers collaborate and support each other.

🌐 About GCC
GCC was formed out of the need for a global community where job seekers can find support and guidance, especially those looking to secure roles abroad. What started with six managers and 30 core members has already grown to include over 130 people, all sharing the same goal: to grow and succeed together. By December, we plan to share projects, practice interviews, and study algorithms, creating a strong, globally connected network. 🚀
